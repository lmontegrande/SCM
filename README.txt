-----About the project

We are creating an SCM System.  The system will use instruction input by the user to determine how to manage the files. The program will hold multiple versions of a file (aka artifacts) and each file will be given distinct names to provide more information to help supplement the versioning system.  To build the project, it has been broken down into smaller more managable parts.

-----Build Instructions
0) Make sure to have java installed on computer and include it's bin files into your System Path
1) Download the project
2) Open command prompt and, from inside there, navigate to src folder of the project
3) run the command "javac *.java" to compile the classes
4) run the command "java Main" to run the program
5) from there, run the command "create [src location] [target location]"

*Note: You can use absolute path, or relative path from the src folder. So "..\.." is allowed for src and target paramaters

-----Usage
This software is intended to provide a base SCM System for working collaboratively on any type of project that requires it's members to manage and create files.

-----Extra Features
The software will implement very simple error handling to ensure that the user has an easier experience using the system.

-----Bugs
N/A so far.  Will be updated as project progresses.

-----External Requirements
This software will require that the user has java 1.8 or higher and a windows PC

*so to reiterate on 2-4
"javac Main.java"
"java Main"
"create [src location] [target location]"

5) run the command "exit" to close the program
